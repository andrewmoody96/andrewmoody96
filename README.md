Hello, my name is Andrew!
------

I am a full-stack developer with a focus on front-end technologies. I am seeking an opportunity to use my skills in development and my creative side to build attractive, real-world solutions for users everywhere. 

Since gaining certification in the MERN stack, I have continued to build my portfolio through personal projects such as [CIYP](https://github.com/andrewmoody96/ciyp) (a site for my band, Chocolate In Your Pocket) and [Dive Buddy](https://github.com/P3-sharkBait/diveBuddy) (a dive computer application with a social network for those who love to scuba dive), self-guided courses, and, of course, lots of time spent in the docs.

#### Please, feel free to check out my [portfolio](https://andrewmoody96.github.io/portfolio-react/) to see what I'm working on now!
